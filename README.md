# Investigating access to safe and affordable drinking water

## Project Overview
 In this project, weâ€™ll investigate access to safe and affordable drinking water focussing on inequalities in service levels between different countries and regions.
 
## Data Sources
Estimates on the use of water-2020 data. The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'Estimates-on-the-use-of-water-2020.csv' containing estimates of household access to drinking water services between 2000 and 2020.

## Tools
- Google Sheets - Data Cleaning 

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the Initial data preparation phase I performed the following tasks:
1. Importing the data and inspection.
   - Multiple separators were used in this dataset. Checked for those instances and split the column headers into columns 
   - Created a new feature 'value_cnt' to count the number of cells in a row that contains a value.
   - No missing values found
2. Calculated the 5-number summary
   - Removed the Outliers

## Exploratory data analysis

EDA involved exploring the dataset to answer key questions, such as 
 - How do the world population estimates compare to the provided dataset populations?
 - What is the tendency and spread of the different water access features?
 - What does the national access to water look like based on national population size?
 - What is the effect of national population size and urbanisation on GNI and water access?
